    # A description for the paper.
    description: The exploitation of suitable technology to transform the wastes from pulp and paper industries (PPI) to value-added products is vital from an environmental and socio-economic point of view. As the volume and complexity of sludge and wastewater increase in a rapidly urbanizing world, the challenge of maintaining efficient wastewater treatment in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner must be met. Sludge management and disposal are significant problems associated with wastewater treatment plants. Applying the biorefinery concept is necessary for PPI from an environmental point of view and because of the piles of valuables contained therein in the form of waste. This review discusses current trends and challenges in wastewater management and the bio-valorization of paper mills. Lignin has been highlighted as a critical component for generating valuables, and its recovery prospects from solid and liquid PPI waste have been suggested.

# Bio
Hi there, welcome! I am Protik Chanda, a B.Tech graduate from the National Institute of Technology(NIT) Durgapur, WB, India. I love learning and exploring new things every day. Currently, I am looking for graduate study opportunities in biotechnology, bioinformatics, and programming-related studies. Programming is one of my hobbies; in my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar and listening to music while dreaming of the wild to embark on a journey, leaving behind the chaotic city. I would be delighted if you find my profile suitable for your lab and work since I actively seek to start my studies and research. Any suggestion or communication is much appreciated.

 ### [B.Tech Thesis Review - Lignin in Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Use](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mroOKWDQP8z2U18yYhP9iOna-8kEUY-y)
 **Abstract** : Lignin is the second most abundant organic polymer or biopolymer found in the
lignocellulosic biomass in natural ecosystem. Recently, biopolymers are one of the most
studied materials among the scientific communities and research groups. Especially their
effectiveness in the development of pharmaceutical and biomedical products is highly
regarded due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low immunogenicity, greater
recyclability, and less energy requirements in processing. Lignin itself being a prominent
biopolymer in the nature positioning itself just after cellulose in terms of quantity, the research
and study related to lignin is relatively new. Owing to the fact that lignin having the
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, prebiotic, antioxidant properties and
lower cytotoxicity make it one of the potential resource for developments of many novel
techniques, especially in pharmaceuticals and biomedical application. Although technical
lignin is being used in many industries for years to generate from bioenergy to products like
surfactants, bonding agents, dispersants and 3d printing materials, the use of lignin based
novel products in pharmaceuticals and biomedical sector is still a vastly unexplored field. As
of now, there are only a few developed techniques are available, of which the most are still in
a stage where they are not ready for use in the applied field due to safety issue, toxicological
evaluation or organizational approval. Some of such successfully developed materials are
hydrogels, nanoparticles, drug delivery system, nanotubes; wound dressing material,
sunscreen lotion etc. There are many obstacles to develop such novel techniques; lignin
valorization is one of that. Lignin being a recalcitrant in nature its complex valorization
process restricts its potential in developing novel products. In the scope of this review, we will
discuss briefly about lignin, its valorization and application, primarily in pharmaceutical and
biomedical field and its obstacles and future prospect.
 ### [7th Semester Project - Biopolymeric Nanocrystal as a Drug Delivery System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QJQa-bRiZDR2NDhTGOEMRAiwn_civFmX)
**Abstract** : For the treatment of diseases, it is essential to deliver the drug into the actual site of the disease
inside the body, which is rather complex to achieve without specialized techniques. A drug delivery
system is such a system, which applies as a formulation, or method that enables the delivery of
medicine selectively to the target cells, tissue or area. Mainly a drug delivery system is used to
achieve therapeutic effects of any medicine or pharmaceutical drugs for a particular disease or
complexity in such a way which has the least toxicological effect to the body or cells. The kinds of
materials used in DDS are liposomes, microspheres, gels, prodrugs etc. Nowadays due to the
advancements in Nanotechnology as multidisciplinary area of science, nano techniques are used to
fabricate polymers to nanometre scale which yields us the polymeric nanocrystal based DDS. Many
of the nanoparticles and polymers has been as drug delivery systems starting from albumin, gelatin
and phospholipids for liposomes, to chemical substances.
